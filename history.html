                    <h2>Founding</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Shu people is an ancient nation in China. Four thousand years ago, the earliest Shu people migrated to Sichuan and established their own kingdom. They created the most brilliant civilization of Sichuan province. Sanxingdui, a 3200 year-old archaeological site might be the kingdom's early capital. Around 2300 years ago, the capital was located in Chengdu. A lot of people think that was the time when Chengdu built. But when Jinsha Culture Site in Chengdu was excavated, the excavation showed the history of founding Chengdu could be as far back as 3,200 years ago.

                    <h2>Ancient History</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the Warring States Period, the Qin dynasty unified China, it destroyed the ancient Shu Kindom and established Shu County in Chengdu. At the end of the Qin dynasty and the beginning of the Han dynasty, Chengdu replaced Guanzhong and was called the "Lad of Abundance". And in subsequent dynasties, Chengdu's economy was very prosperous, and many outstanding literati appeared.

                    <h2>Modern History</h2>
                    <p>
                       The previously flourishing city vanished in the war during the late Ming dynasty, but its economy was recovered in the Qing dynasty. Through two expansions during Kangxi and Qianlong periods, Chengdu was evolved once more, but the role of Chengdu was overtaken by Chongqing during the Opium war. In the modern times, Chengdu was re-establised as the capital of Sichuan province and has remained following the foundation of the PRC.
